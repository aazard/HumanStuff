 ***** Green Skull Inc DIY Skybox and Visor Reflection instructions *****

 When it comes to KSP and skyboxes KSP uses a six sided or Six image "Cube Map" texture. To create a
 skybox from an existing skybox six image format simply rename and follow the image format as listed below. 

 You can also create your own from scratch and there are two options here:

 1. Create your skybox in 6 image format and rename / adjust the image using the following name and format.

 2. Create / find an original single image. There are panorama programmes on the internet to turn your 
 single image into the 6 sides for a skybox. Just google panorama skybox convertor to find one.Then adjust 
 the image using the following name and format.

 You will probably have to edit the images to remove seams which may only be visible in KSP. 
 
 Visor reflections may need an Alpha channel to work correctly.
