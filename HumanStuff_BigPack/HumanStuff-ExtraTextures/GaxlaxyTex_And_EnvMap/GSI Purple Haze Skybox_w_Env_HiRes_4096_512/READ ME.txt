 Welcome to the Green Skull Inc Purple Haze Skybox.
 A lot of hard work has gone into creating many individual and unique textures, 
 patches, badges and logo's.
 Please check the Green Skull Inc. pages on the Kerbal Space Programme Forums regularly
 to keep tabs on:
 - updates and progress of the latest release version
 - new projects 
 as well as hints, tips, bug fixes and Fan Screenshots!

 ***** Installation Instructions *****

 These textures require TextureReplacer.
 
 To install simply place the folder marked TextureReplacer into your Game Data 
 main folder, merging when required.
 
 The address should be something like like C:\Users\Desktop\KSP_win\GameData\TextureReplacer.
